Although social scientists regularly need to visualize the results of their analyses, they receive little training in how to best design their visualizations. This tutorial is for individuals whose goal is to communicate patterns in data as clearly as possible to other consumers of science and is designed to be accessible to both experienced and relatively new users of R and ggplot2. In this article, we assume some basic statistical and visualization knowledge and focus on how to visualize rather than what to visualize. We distill the science and wisdom of data-visualization expertise from books, blogs, and online forum discussion threads into recommendations for social scientists looking to convey their results to other scientists. Overarching design philosophies and color decisions are discussed before giving specific examples of code in R for visualizing central tendencies, proportions, and relationships between variables.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

By orthogonal, we mean there are seven graphical component sets whose elements are aspects of the general system and that every combination of aspects in the product of all these sets is meaningful. This sense of the word orthogonality, a term used by computer designers to describe a combinatoric system of components or building blocks, is in some sense similar to the orthogonal factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA), where factors have levels and all possible combinations of levels exist in the ANOVA design. If we interpret each combination of features in a GOG system as a point in a network, then the world described by GOG is represented in a seven-dimensional rectangular lattice.},
